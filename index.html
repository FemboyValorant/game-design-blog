    <h1 class="title">Hades: Why Roguelikes Should Invest in Narrative
    </h1>
    <h2 class="author">By Matthew Santiago</h2>
    <h2 class="heading intro">Introduction</h2>
    <p>In the fall of 2020, independent studio Supergiant Games released their newest action role-playing game, Hades, and in turn struck gold. At the Game Awards that same year, Hades was nominated for Game of the Year and many other categories, with Supergiant Games taking home Best Indie Game and Best Action game. In Hades, the player takes the role of Zagreus, son of the titular Hades, who attempts to escape his fate as the prince of the Underworld by fighting up from the bottom layer of the Underworld all the way to the surface. Players find themselves engaged with elements of Greek mythology as they combat against legend-inspired monsters and converse with characters iconic in ancient literature. The biggest catch in Zagreus’ journey upwards, is when he finds failure in death, he is sent right back to his home in the Underworld and must try again, to the unrelenting disappointment of his father. The genre of Hades is best described by one word: roguelike. Roguelikes are traditionally gameplay-driven games, with enjoyment primarily stemming from using arcade-like permadeath and procedurally-generated level design to give a fresh experience every game session. Similarly in Hades, players experience this forever cycle of death as part of the core gameplay loop. However, the charm of Hades comes from the ability to use its game world and vibrant characters to round out the fast-paced action gameplay. <strong>Hades uses its historied narrative to build immersion, avoid the common pitfalls of other games in its genre, and create intrinsic rewards to become one of the best roguelikes to come out in recent years.</strong></p>
    <h2 class="heading">High Level Concept #1 - Immersion: Agency and Game World</h2>
    <p>Immersing the player is one of Hades’ strong suits and is not created by one singular concept in the game’s design. One of the three facets of immersion listed by Jennett et al. (2008), is “Involvement and a sense of being in the task environment”. Immersion is scaffolded by several key factors in the expansive lore of the game world, to the moment to moment decisions the player makes during their run, contributing to Supergiant’s ability to create “The Magic Circle”. The world of Hades is well-written and expansive, backed by years of Greek mythos. In Hades, power-ups come in the form of “boons”, sent from Mount Olympus by characters representing the iconic Greek Gods. These short dialogues, in addition to environmental flavor text, allow Zagreus and the player to take a small break from combat and gain insight to the world around them.</p>
